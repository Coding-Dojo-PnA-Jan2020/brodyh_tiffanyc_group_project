# Ordering Web Application Proposal

  Ordering Web Application will be exactly that â€” a platform for restaurant clients to browse and select a restaurant's offerings and to order them for either in-store pickup or delivery.

  Restaurant menu items will be complete with names, descriptions, photos as well as pricing. Users will be presented with all of a restaurant's menu items and be prompted to order them.

  Administrative users will have the additional ability to create, update and destroy menu items from listings and set pricing accordingly.

## Minimum Viable Product

1. Users must be able to register and sign in
    - Administrative users will have the ability to update product listings
    - Users may have multiple addresses but a single contact phone number and email address
2. Menu items must be complete with names, descriptions, photos and pricing
3. A virtual cart will be provided allowing users to build their order of menu items they wish to purchase
4. Upon payment, the cart's contents will be saved as an order
5. Administrative users will be able to view orders
